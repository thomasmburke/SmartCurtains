Create CI/CD pipeline on AWS
- I have created a key pair jenkins.pem in downloads
- updated access keys for the tomMacbook user

Next Steps:

CloudFormation:
---------------
create cloudformation template for ECS and pipeline
create-stack based on cludformation template

JENKINS Server:
--------------
This will be used to build a docker image from a dockerfile and push that image to the AWS ECR registry. Then create a task definition for my container.
more to come after I create cloudformation templates
